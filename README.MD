# Lab 4: Introduction to Functions

This assignment consists of two main files: `index.html` and `script.js`.

## index.html

The `index.html` file sets up the basic structure of the webpage. It includes:

- A `DOCTYPE` declaration and basic HTML structure.
- Meta tags for character set and viewport settings.
- A title for the webpage: "Lab 4".
- A header (`<h1>`) that displays "Lab 4 Page introduction to function".
- A script tag that links to the `script.js` file.

## script.js

The `script.js` file is where the JavaScript code for this assignment will be written. This file will contain functions that demonstrate various concepts introduced in Lab 4.

To get started, open `index.html` in a web browser and ensure that it correctly links to and executes the code in `script.js`.
